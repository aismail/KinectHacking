HmmLib: Hidden Markov Model Library in Java<BR>
<SPAN class="cvsid">$Id: readme.html,v 1.5 2003/05/28 04:57:47 drwye Exp $</SPAN>
</DIV>

<P>
<B>HmmLib</B> is a Java class library which contains all
essential functionalities of hidden Markov models (HMMs).
It is not intended to be used for commercial purposes, for
the efficiency was not the primary factor in its implementation.
Rather, it is hoped that the implementation is clear and transparent
enough that it can be used as a model program for students wishing 
to learn basics of HMMs.
<B>HmmLib</B> is now a part of a larger software package called <B>HmmSDK</B>.
Please visit 
<A href="http://hmmsdk.sourceforge.net/">its home page</A> 
for more information.

<H3>System Requirements</H3>

<P>
You need the version 1.4 or later of the software development kit for
<A HREF="http://java.sun.com/j2se/">
Java 2 Platform Standard Edition (J2SE)</A>
in order to be able to use this library.

If you have an eariler version of JDK, then you might still be able to use this: You'll need some extra libraries like XML parsers, and you might have to comment out some JDK1.4 specific keywords such as <I>assert</I>. This configuration is, however, not supported, and <B>HmmLib</B> is currently being developed only with JDK 1.4.
</P>
