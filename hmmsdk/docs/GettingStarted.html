HmmSDK Development: Getting Started
</DIV>

<P>
If you would like to contribute to the <B>HmmSDK</B> project,
you will need to talk to one of the <A href="mailto:hmmsdk-admin@lists.sourceforge.net">admins</A> of the project first.
The main component of 
<B>HmmSDK</B> is a library program written in Java, but
you don't have to be a Java programmer to participate in this project.
<em>Any</em> contribution commensurate with the overall goal of the project
will be appreciated.

Please visit 
<A href="http://hmmsdk.sourceforge.net/">its home page</A> 
for more information.
</P>


<P>
Once you decide that you would participate in the project,
please follow the instructions below.
This is essentially a summary of many relevant documents
found in <A href="http://sourceforge.net/docman/?group_id=1">SourceForge.net Doc Page</A>.
</P>



<H3>Setting Up Your Development Environment</H3>

<P>
<OL>
<LI>If you don't have an account at <A href="http://www.sourceforge.net/">SourceForge.net</A>,
then the first thing you need to do is
to <A href="https://sourceforge.net/account/register.php">register</A> as a user.
</LI>
<LI>Send email to the <A href="mailto:hmmsdk-admin@lists.sourceforge.net">project admins</A>
with your intention to join.
Once you are approved, you will be given the <em>Developer Privilege</em>
and/or any other appropriate permissions depending on the role you would like to assume in the project.
</LI>
<LI>Join the <A href="http://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/hmmsdk-devel">developer mailing list</A>.
It can take up to a day before your request for subscription is processed.
So, it's important to do this as soon as possible.
(This is the time when you will need most help from fellow developers.)
</LI>
<!--
<LI>You can also set your account to "monitor" <em>Forums for Developers</em>....
</LI>
-->
<LI>You will need SSH clients (compliant with either SSH1 or SSH2 protocol)
in order to be able to access CVS repository. I use
<A href="http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/">PuTTY</A>
on Windows platform.
Please refer to <A href="http://sourceforge.net/docman/display_doc.php?docid=6841&group_id=1">this document</A> on SourceForge.net for more information.
</LI>
<LI>Create a CVS home directory. This is a one-time process before you can use CVS on SourceForge.net. Here's <A href="http://sourceforge.net/docman/display_doc.php?docid=768&group_id=1#develhomedir">detailed instructions</A>.
</LI>
<LI>Generate SSH key pairs. Here's the link to the <A href="http://sourceforge.net/docman/display_doc.php?docid=761&group_id=1">SourceForge document</A>. You can follow the steps in <A href="http://sourceforge.net/docman/display_doc.php?docid=766&group_id=1#sshkeygen">this note</A> if you are using PuTTY on Windows.
</LI>
<LI>Upload the public key. This step is also very well explained in the <A href="http://sourceforge.net/docman/display_doc.php?docid=761&group_id=1">SSH document</A> or in <A href="http://sourceforge.net/docman/display_doc.php?docid=766&group_id=1#sshkeyupload">this section</A> of the PuTTY document.
</LI>
<LI>Install/configure CVS client.
If you are using Windows, <A href="http://www.wincvs.org/">WinCVS</A> is recommended.
Set your CVSROOT to <B><i>yourusername</i>@cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/hmmsdk</B>
with the <em>ssh</em> authentication protocol.
<A href="http://sourceforge.net/docman/display_doc.php?docid=6841&group_id=1">This document</A>
has a very nice step-by-step instruction on how to set up WinCVS and PuTTY together.
If you are new to CVS, then you might want to spend some time familiarizing
yourself with basic functionalities of CVS. Again 
<A href="http://sourceforge.net/docman/?group_id=1">documentation on SourceForge.net</A>
is a good starting point.
</LI>
<LI>Now the hard part is over.
It is a good time to subscribe to the
<A href="http://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/hmmsdk-commit">CVS commit message mailing list</A>
in order to get informed of any changes made to the files in the repository.
</LI>
<LI>For a list of active modules in the project, try <tt>'cvs co -c'</tt> or use any correponding command in your CVS client.
Check out necessary modules and you are all set!
(Please ask for help from existing members regarding which modules you need to check out.)
If you are a software developer,
you will probably want to check out the <em>HmmLib</em> module first (among others).
The following steps are only necessary if you intend to do some programming.
(Obviously, you will need to have <A href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/">JDK</A> (v1.4 or later)
and <A href="http://ant.apache.org/">Ant</A> installed on your system
before you can proceed. We will assume that it has already been done.)
</LI>
<LI>Once you check out the <em>HmmLib</em> module, please spend a bit
of time browsing through the directory structure.
(Most modules have a very similar structure.)
The build files are kept under the directory, <em>bin</em>.
Build.xml is the common Ant build script, and some user-specific properties
can be set in the build.properties file (not being used as of this writing).
</LI>
<LI>Some of the libraries in the <em>lib</em> directory are needed
for Ant build process (custom ant tasks).
You can either include these lib files
(bluecraft.common-<i>M.m</i>.jar and bluecraft.tools-<i>M.m</i>.jar) in your
system-level classpath, or you can use some kind of shell scripts
to set the classpath before you call Ant.
Please look at the Windows build.bat file for an example.
(Note that Ant should be invoked from the <em>bin</em> directory.)
</LI>
<LI>You can find Java source files under <em>src/java</em>.
Please try building the hmmlib module at this point.
You might have to manually create a directory called <em>build</em>
as a sibling of <em>bin</em> before you can build the module.
(Use <tt>ant -projecthelp</tt> to list available targets.
<tt>Compileall</tt> is the default target.)
If everything goes well, then the output should be
generated under the <em>build</em> directory.
</LI>
<LI>BTW, do not check in the file, com.bluecraft.hmmlib.buildnum.txt,
under the <em>bin</em> directory. This file is used to generate
version/build number for <em>official</em> releases.
</LI>
<LI>If you would like to build all modules whose names start with <em>hmm</em>,
then check out all modules first and 
use the master Ant build file under <em>bin</em> in the <em>HmmAll</em> module.
Include definitions like
<tt>hmmlib.project.dir=E:/hmmsdk/hmmlib</tt> and
<tt>hmmbox.project.dir=E:/hmmsdk/hmmbox</tt>
in your <i>build.properties</i> file.
</LI>
