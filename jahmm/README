JAHMM   -   QUICK START GUIDE
-----------------------------


Jahmm is a Java library implementing the various, well-known algorithms
related to Hidden Makov Models (HMMs for short).

The source code of the library is available; it is licensed under GPL
(see the resource/COPYING file).

This library is short and simple.  It's been written for clarity.  It
is particularly well suited for research and academic use.

The website associated to this library is:
http://jahmm.googlecode.com/
Most information related to this software can be found there.



COMPILING
~~~~~~~~~

To compile the library, you simply need to compile all the files held
in the src/main/java directory.  Thus, simply calling 'javac' with all the
.java files held in the 'src' directory as arguments compiles everything.

Compiling can be done using the 'maven' build tool (see maven.apache.org) by
typing 'mvn compile' in the root directory of the distribution (where the
'pom.xml' file resides).

This can also be done using 'ant' (see http://ant.apache.org/) by
typing 'ant' in the root directory of the distribution (where the 'build.xml'
file resides).

Jahmm requires Java 1.5.0.

The generated .class files will be put in the 'target/classes' directory.



RUNNING
~~~~~~~

Notice that if you just want to try the library, you don't have to
compile it.  '.jar' files for each jahmm release are available on the
website; to use it, simply launch:

javac -classpath /path/to/jahmm-<version>.jar Myprogram.java

...to compile your program, and:

java -cp /path/to/jahmm-<version>.jar myMainClass

(e.g. java -cp /home/smith/java_class/jahmm-0.6.2.jar test/Testing)

...to run it.
You can also put the '.jar' file in your classpath.



TESTING
~~~~~~~

Once the library has been compiled, you can launch a sample program by typing:

mvn -Psample compile
(if you use maven)

or

ant sample
(if you use ant)

...in the distribution root directory.  This launches the 'SimpleExample.java'
sample program.

Regression (JUnit) tests have also been written ; see build.xml/pom.xml and the 
src/test/java/be/ac/ulg/montefiore/run/jahmm/test directory.  To launch those tests,
use 'ant junit' or 'mvn test'.
